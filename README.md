# CkNN

C implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.  Used as a terminal program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For now, compilation requires <b>gcc</b>.

### Building

Building is fairly simple. The simplest way is through the <b>makefile</b> in the <b>build/</b> directory:

```
make build/cknn
```

## Usage

CkNN is a terminal tool. It's usage is really simple; from the root directory of the repo:

```
./cknn training_data.csv unclassified_data.csv classifications.csv class_column k
``` 

, where:

- ``` training_data.csv ``` - the <b>csv</b> file with classifications, <br>
- ``` unclassified_data.csv ``` - the <b>csv</b> file with unclassified data that we want to classify, <br>
- ``` classifications.csv ``` - the <b>csv</b> file where the classifications for ``` unclassified_data.csv ``` are written, where rows act as the key between the classification generated by the program and the ``` unclassified_data.csv ``` for which it was generated, <br>
- ``` class_column ``` - the class column in ``` training_data.csv ```, <br>
- ``` k ``` - k value. <br>


### Data Requirements

For now, ``` cknn ``` can only use <b>csv</b> data following this format:

```
x1,y1,z1,classA
x2,y2,z2,classB
...
```

Dataset headers are still not included, so it's required that they are removed.
